# Getter/Setter Work

Initial infrastructure for ES5.1 accessor properties is in place. A new `Accessor` object stores getter and setter pairs in property buckets flagged with `ACCESSOR_FLAG`.

`Object.defineProperty` now accepts descriptor objects containing `get` or `set` and forwards the functions to the runtime without invoking the blocking `Runtime::call` path.

However, accessor properties remain non-functional: the example in `examples/getter_setter_example.cpp` still prints `obj.value = undefined` and leaves `obj._v` unchanged. Further work is needed to wire descriptor plumbing to property lookup and write paths.

Current limitations:
- Descriptor validation is minimal and object literal `get`/`set` syntax is still unparsed.
- Redefinition semantics and strict mode error handling remain incomplete.
- Runtime `support.defineProperty` receives `undefined` for the `get` and `set` slots, indicating argument propagation from the
  JavaScript wrapper is still broken.
