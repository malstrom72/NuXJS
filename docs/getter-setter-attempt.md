# Getter/Setter Implementation Attempt

This experiment added a new `Accessor` type, an `ACCESSOR_FLAG`, and runtime hooks so that `Object::getProperty` can invoke a getter when an accessor bucket is encountered.

The build succeeds, but accessor properties are still not usable because:
- `Object.defineProperty` only creates data properties; descriptor objects with `get` or `set` are ignored.
- No code path populates buckets with `ACCESSOR_FLAG` or links setter functions.
- Setter invocation and attribute bits are unimplemented.

Further work would need parser and library updates to create accessor descriptors and an implementation of `setProperty` that triggers setter functions.
